## NIFTY options CALL/PUT analysis
There are three stages to make a shiny app  <br />
1. Web scraping of NSE options information  <br />
⋅⋅* Here we need to use **niftyoptions.R** for downloading options call/put price tag from www.nseindia.com and store it 
in options.csv and cmp.csv <br />
2. User interface definition <br />
